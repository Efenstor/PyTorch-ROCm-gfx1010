# Using with chaiNNer

If you have a new installation then run chaiNNer, let it download all the basic components but don't install any dependencies.

Then execute:

    cd <your_chaiNNer_directory>/python/python/bin
    ./chainner_pip install <torch.whl> <torchvision.whl>

Replace <torch.whl\> and <torchvision.whl\> with paths to the wheels you built.

After that run chaiNNer and install all the rest of the dependencies.
